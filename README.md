IARL Mobile.apk
===============

This Android app will (eventually) enable you to carry useful radio repeater
information with you in your pocket.

Based on your (GPS) location you will be presented a list of HAM radio relays
that are close to your location, also you will be able to get all kinds of
information about them.

There is also a map view that visualise where the relays are located on the
map relative to your location.

Currently, the app is not available from the Android Market, nor is there a
binary build. If you want to get updates on the Android app subscribe to the
mailing list at [http://list.iarl.org/listinfo/iarl](list.iarl.org).

If you are interested in testing the app, please contact
